Product sequence
================

This module adds a Product Sequence to the default_code field.

After installation, a new field "Internal Reference Sequence" is set in Product Category.
By this way, you can create different sequences for each category.
Once a sequence set, all products from that category will have a Internal Reference set when saving the first time.
The sequence creation will be aborted if the user set manualy a value for this field.
